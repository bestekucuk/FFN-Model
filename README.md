## Introduction
---
Text classification plays a crucial role in Natural Language Processing (NLP), finding applications in sentiment analysis, news categorization, and automated customer review analysis. This study focuses on developing a text classification model using deep learning techniques, specifically Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), on a substantial dataset comprising 871,909 articles. The primary goal is to categorize texts into 26 distinct categories. The proposed model is intended for integration into a mobile application, targeting a success rate of 61%. The outcomes of this research showcase the effectiveness of text classification on large datasets and demonstrate practical applications in real-world scenarios.
